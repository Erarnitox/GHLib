# ToolingLib - Boilerplate for GameHacking

This library is a set of helper functionality that I wrote for game hacking purposes.

It is old code and should only server as a template for your own helper-library.

If you want to use a more mature and powerful game hacking library, please check out LibMem by RDBO here:

https://github.com/rdbo/libmem

LibMem is awesome and much more mature.
But if you just want very simple helper functions/snippets, feel free to use this library as a starting point
